# Map
 
 I created a map which provides details about volcanoes point in US and population levels around the world.
 <br>Each volcano elevation can be seen by clicking the volcanoes points in the map. The elevation and population levels are shown by different colors for a better understanding. You can hide/unhide each layer by clicking the small icon at the top right.
 <br>Hope to enjoy it!
